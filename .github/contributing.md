# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome! Here are some guidelines.


## Pull-Request and Issue

- Search past and current issues and pull-requests for previous suggestions
before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate or a work in progress.

- Only one list item per commit.

- Only one commit per pull-request. Always squash commits after applying
  changes.

- Check your spelling and grammar.

- Remove any trailing whitespaces.

- Use spaces, no tabs, for indention.

- Send a pull-request with the reason why the linked resource is awesome.


## Linting

First and foremost, have your pull-request pass the [official Awesome List's
linter](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-lint). No extra work is
required here as it is [already integrated by the way of GitHub
actions](./workflows/).

To run the linter locally, do:

```
$ npm install --global awesome-lint
$ awesome-lint
```


## Additional rules

Here are some formatting style not enforced by the linter (yet), which are
specific to this awesome list.

- Cut long lines of text after 80 characters. Only exception is to let Markdown
content be properly rendered.

- If one of these rule conflict with the linter, the linter's rule should takes
precedence. Apply it.


## List items

- Link title must be [title-cased](http://titlecapitalization.com), AP style.

- URL must use HTTPs protocol if available.

- Keep descriptions concise, maximum number of characters is 350.


## Sections

- Add a section if needed.

- Eventually add a description to the section.
